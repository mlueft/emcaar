Emcaar stands for Embroidery card archive. This project tries to preserve information about embroidery cards. Embroidery cards where used to transfere digital embroidery data from computers to embroidery machines in the 90s till early 2000s. Today it's a dying technology and nearly no technical information about it can be found on the web.

I bought a death embroidery machine on ebay just for the fun of repairing it. And finally I couldn't bring any data to it, because of that proprietary technology. Luckily I have got a used card reader and a card. Unfortunately Something didn't work and I had to do some research and traffic analyzes to see what's going on.

Now I want to store that knowledge for others working with such cards.
